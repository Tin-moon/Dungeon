# The Dungeon


Dungeon is a dungeon crawler/exploration game with roguelike elements. randomly generated levels, randomized loot and quests, and lots of risky items that are "unidentified" until you try them. The goal of the game is to get to the bottom of the dungeon and meet NPC's along the way to get the full story about the dungeon and learn why you are there.

Like other roguelikes, each floor of the dungeon and its items and quests are randomly generated.  This creates a unique experience for the player each time they play.
