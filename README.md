# The Dungeon


The Dungeon is a dungeon crawler/exploration game with roguelike elements, randomly generated levels, puzzles, loot, quests, and lots of risky items that are "unidentified" until you try them.

Like other roguelikes, each floor of the dungeon and its items and quests are randomly generated.  This creates a unique experience for the player each time they play.
